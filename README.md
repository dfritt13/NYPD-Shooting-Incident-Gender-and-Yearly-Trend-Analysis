This is an analysis done for a Master's degree course, DTSA 5301: Data Science as a Field at Colorado Boulder. 
It was used to teach students about R, R-Studio, data visualization, analysis and basic modeling. 
I have not used R-studio before this project so this was a great learning opportunity. 

The analysis covers two things:
1. What is the rate of shooting occurences in New York year over year for each New York Borough?
2. What are the gender dynamics involved in shooting incidents (i.e., what gender what the perpetrator and what gender was the victim?).

Answers to these questions and the analysis can be found in NYPD_shooting_incidident_markdown.rmd and NYPD_shooting_incidident_markdown.pdf
